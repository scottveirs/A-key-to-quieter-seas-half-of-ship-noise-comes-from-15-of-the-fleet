<div class="ltx_p"></div><h1 data-label="682536" class="ltx_title_section">Methods</h1><div class="ltx_p">We assessed four distinct management options by analyzing 2,800 source
level measurements of 1,582 unique, isolated ships recorded as they
transited northbound in Haro Strait, a shipping channel within the
Salish Sea&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Veirs2016-tb}</cite>. For ships in the data set with multiple transits we
averaged the source spectrum levels (power spectral density) over all
available transits.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">To assess the relative noise contributions of different ships in the
population of 1,582 ships in 12 ship classes, we integrated the source
spectrum levels for each unique ship to acquire the total power (watts)
radiated by each ship in a frequency band (10-40,000 Hz). This band is
wider than the 10-300 Hz band stipulated in the noise reduction target
endorsed by the IWC. We chose to broaden the band because ship noise at
ranges less than ~3 km extends beyond 300 Hz to
frequencies where SRKW hearing is most sensitive &nbsp;and because ship noise has been identified by regulatory agencies in
Canada and the U.S. as a chronic, habitat-level stressor threatening the
recovery of the endangered killer whale population in this region <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Williams2016-rl}</cite>.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">After integration, we sorted the total radiated power levels, ranking
them from lowest to highest. Then we summed the power from each ship,
yielding the cumulative total radiated power – a distribution we used
to assess quantitatively a range of management options that would
accomplish a 3 dB reduction in the total noise radiated by this
population of ships. (A 3 dB reduction is equivalent to halving the
total radiated power.) Finally, we converted individual ship source
levels from watts to dB re 1 μPa @ 1m. &nbsp;(Note, however, that we
abbreviate the resulting broadband (10-40,000 Hz) source levels as
“dB” in this paper for brevity.)</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">We used an iterative method to understand the first two management
options: removal of gross polluters; and reduction of gross polluter
source levels to a threshold that achieves the desired halving of power
overall. For the first option, we removed the loudest ship from the
population and re-calculated the total radiated power. If the initial
total power was not yet halved, then we repeated the process. For the
second option, we also calculated the reduction threshold iteratively.
&nbsp;We lowered the source level of the loudest ship to the level of the
next-loudest ship in each iteration until the total power radiated by
the population was halved.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">To help managers more deeply understand the practical implications of
these two management options, we tabulated the number of ships affected
(Table 1). To allow easy extrapolation to the global fleet or other
regional subpopulations of it, we also tabulated the number of affected
ships as a percentage of both our population and, where applicable, the
total number of ships in each class.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">The third noise management option was based on the observation that for
many ships a 1 knot reduction in speed leads to 1 dB reduction in
broadband underwater source level&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Veirs_2006}</cite>. We found the speed limit needed to achieve the 3 dB reduction
iteratively by: reducing the speed of each loudest ship to the selected
speed limit; making a proportional reduction in the source levels;
re-integrating the new source level distribution; and checking to see if
the reduced total power equaled half of the initial total power.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">The fourth management option was requiring a 3 dB reduction of every
ship in the fleet. Assessing this option required no new computation.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">For all options, we assumed that the distribution of source levels in
our data set was statistically representative of the noise output from
the global fleet, or other regional subsets of it. &nbsp;This assumption
underpins our assertion that our regional data set can be used to assess
options for managing oceanic noise beyond our study area.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div>
