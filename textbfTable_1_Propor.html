<div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p"><b>Table 1. Proportions of fleet and classes affected by two management options aim</b></div><div class="ltx_p">The portion of the fleet that would be affected by two management
options aimed at gross polluters. One option removes gross polluters
(ships with source levels greater than 179 dB) while the other requires
them to use quieting technologies or techniques to reduce their source
levels below a threshold of 175.4 dB. The 2nd column lists the total
number of ships in the fleet (“All classes”) and in each class. Then
for each option and ship class we tabulate the number of ships affected,
along with that number expressed as a percentage of the whole fleet
(1,582 ships) and as a percentage of the ship class (where applicable or
non-zero).</div>
