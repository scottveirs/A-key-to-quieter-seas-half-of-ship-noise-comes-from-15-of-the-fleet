<div class="ltx_p"></div><h1 data-label="238917" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div class="ltx_p">At its June 2016 meeting, the Scientific Committee of the International
Whaling Commission (IWC) agreed that chronic ocean noise is increasing
in many regions and adversely affecting populations of whales and other
cetaceans <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{IWC_Scientific_Committee2016-jv}</cite>. Emerging evidence links chronic ocean noise to
negative effects not only on marine mammals <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Rolland_2012,Williams2015-fd}</cite>&nbsp;but also fish <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Popper2016-vo}</cite> and invertebrates <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Wale_2013}</cite>. Ships are a major source of chronic ocean
noise, responsible for doubling low-frequency levels every decade
throughout the second half of the 20th century <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{McDonald_2006,Andrew_2011}</cite>. In some coastal and other
high-traffic areas, ship noise has reached levels that degrade habitat
for endangered species of whales and other marine wildlife <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Hatch_2012,Erbe_2014}</cite>.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">These developments have inspired a number of recent policy initiatives
to reduce noise pollution from ships. Prominently, the International
Maritime Organization issued voluntary guidelines in 2014, building on
earlier targets&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Wright2008-lr}</cite> and encouraging industry to reduce underwater radiated ship noise
in the 10-300 Hz band&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Dekeling2014-fe,Imomepc2014-uj}</cite>. In 2016 the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration  launched an agency-wide&nbsp;<a href="http://cetsound.noaa.gov/road-map" target="_blank">Ocean
Noise Strategy</a> to better integrate risk assessment and mitigation of
chronic ambient noise pollution into federal planning actions. European
legislation treats ocean noise as a pollutant, and requires member
states ultimately to attain “good environmental status” with respect
to noise across multiple marine regions&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Urn2014-qf,Audoly2015-ld,Garrett2016-ld,Merchant2016-xo}</cite>. In
some jurisdictions, most recently Canada, governments have committed
themselves to regulate shipping noise, but none have yet devised a
management system to meet a ship noise reduction target.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">In addition to aspirational targets to improve global ocean health,
efforts to reduce ship noise also have immediate
implications for economic development and endangered species
conservation. The southern resident killer whale (SRKW) is an endangered population with critical habitat that spans the international
(Canada-U.S.) border and encompasses shipping lanes serving the ports of Vancouver
(British Columbia, Canada) and Seattle-Tacoma (WA, U.S.). Both Canada
and the U.S. have recognized ocean noise as a threat to SRKW recovery&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Nmfs2008-zq,DFO_Canada2011-di}</cite>. There are a number of large-scale industrial development
proposals pending for this region&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Gaydos2015-wh}</cite> that could increase ship traffic and raise ocean noise levels.
Both countries must consider ocean noise in SRKW critical habitat when
assessing environmental impacts of proposed developments, and balance
economic growth with conservation of endangered species. All of SRKW
summertime critical habitat is ensonified already at levels exceeding
one European threshold defining good environmental status&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Christine_Erbe2012-cg}</cite>, so it could be argued that noise reduction has become
a necessary precursor to additional industrial development in this
region.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">What would be required of industry to substantially reduce noise from
commercial ships, which originates primarily from cavitation at the propeller, but also from engine and machinery noises tranms? To understand what would be necessary, we considered
the quantitative noise reduction target reaffirmed in the summer of 2016 by the
IWC’s Scientific Committee, namely reducing the contributions of
shipping to ocean ambient noise in the 10-300 Hz frequency band by 3 dB
(halving the total radiated power) within 10 years, and by 10 dB within
30 years&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{IWC_Scientific_Committee2016-jv}</cite>. We explored various mechanisms to attain this -3
dB/decade target, including reducing the number, acoustic source level,
or speed of ships.</div>
