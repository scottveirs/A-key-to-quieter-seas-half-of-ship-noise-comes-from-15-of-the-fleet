<div class="ltx_p"></div><h1 data-label="238917" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div class="ltx_p">At its June 2016 meeting, the Scientific Committee of the International
Whaling Commission (IWC) agreed that chronic ocean noise is increasing
in many regions and adversely affecting populations of whales and other
cetaceans <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{IWC_Scientific_Committee2016-jv}</cite>. Emerging evidence links chronic ocean noise to
negative effects not only on marine mammals <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Rolland_2012,Williams2015-fd}</cite>&nbsp;but also fish <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Popper2016-vo}</cite> and invertebrates <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Wale_2013}</cite>. Ships are a major source of chronic ocean
noise, responsible for doubling low-frequency levels every decade
throughout the second half of the 20th century <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{McDonald_2006,Andrew_2011}</cite>. In some coastal and other
high-traffic areas, ship noise has reached levels that degrade habitat
for endangered species of whales and other marine wildlife <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Hatch_2012,Erbe_2014}</cite>.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">These developments have inspired a number of recent policy initiatives
to reduce noise pollution from ships. Prominently, the International
Maritime Organization issued voluntary guidelines in 2014, building on
earlier targets&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Wright2008-lr}</cite> and encouraging industry to reduce underwater radiated ship noise
in the 10-300 Hz band&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Dekeling2014-fe,Imomepc2014-uj}</cite>. In 2016 the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration  launched an agency-wide&nbsp;<a href="http://cetsound.noaa.gov/road-map" target="_blank">Ocean
Noise Strategy</a> to better integrate risk assessment and mitigation of
chronic ambient noise pollution into federal planning actions. European
legislation treats ocean noise as a pollutant, and requires member
states ultimately to attain “good environmental status” with respect
to noise across multiple marine regions&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Urn2014-qf,Audoly2015-ld,Garrett2016-ld,Merchant2016-xo}</cite>. In
some jurisdictions, most recently Canada, governments have committed
themselves to regulate shipping noise, but none have yet devised a
management system to meet a ship noise reduction target.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">In addition to aspirational targets to improve global ocean health,
efforts to reduce ship noise also have immediate
implications for economic development and endangered species
conservation. The southern resident killer whale (SRKW) is an endangered population with critical habitat that spans the international
(Canada-U.S.) border and encompasses shipping lanes serving the ports of Vancouver
(British Columbia, Canada) and Seattle-Tacoma (WA, U.S.). Both Canada
and the U.S. have recognized ocean noise as a threat to SRKW recovery&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Nmfs2008-zq,DFO_Canada2011-di}</cite>. There are a number of large-scale industrial development
proposals pending for this region&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Gaydos2015-wh}</cite> that could increase ship traffic and raise ocean noise levels.
Both countries must consider ocean noise in SRKW critical habitat when
assessing environmental impacts of proposed developments, and balance
economic growth with conservation of endangered species. All of SRKW
summertime critical habitat is ensonified already at levels exceeding
one European threshold defining good environmental status&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Christine_Erbe2012-cg}</cite>, so it could be argued that noise reduction has become
a necessary precursor to additional industrial development in this
region.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">What would be required of industry to substantially reduce noise from
commercial ships (which originates primarily from cavitation at the propeller, but also from shipboard machinery noise transmitted through the hull)? To understand what would be necessary, we considered
the quantitative noise reduction target reaffirmed in the summer of 2016 by the
IWC’s Scientific Committee, namely reducing the contributions of
shipping to ocean ambient noise in the 10-300 Hz frequency band by 3 dB
(halving the total radiated power) within 10 years, and by 10 dB within
30 years&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{IWC_Scientific_Committee2016-jv}</cite>. We explored various mechanisms to attain this -3
dB/decade target, including reducing the number, acoustic source level,
or speed of ships.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><h1 data-label="682536" class="ltx_title_section">Methods</h1><div class="ltx_p">We assessed four distinct management options by using an R script (seto analyze 2,800 source
level measurements of 1,582 unique, isolated ships recorded as they
transited northbound in Haro Strait, a shipping channel within the
Salish Sea&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Veirs2016-tb}</cite>. For ships in the data set with multiple transits we
averaged the source spectrum levels (power spectral density) over all
available transits.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">To assess the relative noise contributions of different ships in our sample of the local fleet (the population of 1,582 ships in 12 ship classes northbound in Haro Strait), we integrated the source
spectrum levels for each unique ship to acquire the total power (watts)
radiated by each ship in a frequency band relevant to SRKWs (10-40,000 Hz). This band is
wider than the 10-300 Hz band stipulated in the noise reduction target
endorsed by the IWC. We chose to broaden the band because ship noise at
ranges less than ~3 km extends beyond 300 Hz to
frequencies where SRKW hearing is most sensitive <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Veirs2016-tb}</cite>.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">After integration, we sorted the total radiated power levels for all ships, ranking
them from lowest to highest. Then we summed the power from all ships,
yielding the cumulative total radiated power – a distribution we used
to assess quantitatively a range of management options that would
accomplish a 3 dB reduction in the total noise radiated by this
population of ships.  Finally, we converted individual ship source
levels from watts to dB re 1 μPa @ 1m. &nbsp;(Note, however, that we
abbreviate the resulting broadband (10-40,000 Hz) source levels as
“dB” in this paper for brevity.)</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">We used an iterative method to understand the first two management
options: removal of gross polluters (ships with the highest source levels of the fleet); and reduction of gross polluter
source levels to a threshold that achieves the desired halving of power
overall. For the first option, we removed the loudest ship from the
population and re-calculated the total radiated power of the remaining fleet. If the initial
total power was not yet halved, then we repeated the process. For the
second option, we also calculated the reduction threshold iteratively.
&nbsp;We lowered the source level of the loudest ship to the level of the
next-loudest ship in each iteration until the total power radiated by
the fleet was halved.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">To help managers more deeply understand the practical implications of
these two management options, we tabulated the number of ships affected
(Table 1). To allow easy extrapolation to the global fleet or other
regional subpopulations of it, we also tabulated the number of affected
ships as a percentage of both our population and, where applicable, the
total number of ships in each class.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">The third noise management option was motivated by the observation that for
many ships a 1 knot reduction in speed leads to 1 dB reduction in
broadband underwater source level&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Veirs2016-tb}</cite>. We found the speed limit needed to achieve the 3 dB reduction
iteratively by: reducing the speed of each loudest ship to the selected
speed limit; making a proportional reduction in the source levels (assuming the -1dB/knot relationship applied to all ships);
re-integrating the new source level distribution; and checking to see if
the reduced total power equaled half of the initial total power.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">The fourth management option was requiring a 3 dB reduction of every
ship in the fleet. Assessing this option required no new computation.</div>
