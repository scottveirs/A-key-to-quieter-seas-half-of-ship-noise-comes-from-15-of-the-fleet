<h1 data-label="189335" class="ltx_title_section">Results and discussion</h1><div class="ltx_p">The cumulative distribution of source levels (Figure 1) in our dataset
ranges from 141-186 dB and has two inflection points, with
~80% of the population having intermediate source
levels of 165-180 dB. Importantly, half the total power is radiated by
just 15% of the ships in the fleet (i.e., those with source levels
greater than 179.0 dB). More than two-thirds of these gross polluters
are cargo and container ships, with each class containing
~90 such vessels in our population (Table 1, Figure 2).
About 43% of container ships are gross polluters, by far the highest
proportion of any ship class in our dataset.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">Management options could focus on gross polluters by targeting fleet
size or operations. In the region where our data originated, for
example, managers could halve the total power radiated by this ship
population by removing the loudest 15% of the fleet
(n=~240 ships) or by reducing the source levels of the
loudest 42.8% of the fleet (n=~677 ships) to 175.4 dB
(Table 1). These results confirm empirically the idea of dramatically reducing acoustic pollution by targeting the
noisiest ships for quieting <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Leaper2014-re}</cite>. The maximum reduction required by the 175.4
dB threshold, about 10 dB, should be attainable with existing quieting
technologies <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Southall2008-af}</cite> and techniques <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Audoly2015-ld}</cite>, or
for many types of new ships with only a 1% increase in design/build
costs <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Spence2016-js}</cite>.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">Because container ships had the highest average source levels (178+/-4
dB) of the 12 ship classes we analyzed <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Veirs2016-tb}</cite>, they would be most affected by policies that target gross
polluters (Table 1). In our population of container ships, 43% would be
affected by the removal option, while almost 90% would be affected by
the noise reduction option. By contrast, some ship classes would be
completely unaffected by any management option that limits source
levels. No fishery, pleasure, or military ships in our population had
source levels exceeding 175 dB, possibly due to military, fishery, and
research classes having already adopted ship-quieting technologies <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Southall2008-af}</cite>, including propellers with higher c.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">Of the management options considered, speed limits appear most likely to
reduce noise quickly – by making an operational change, rather than
undertaking replacements, retrofits, or maintenance. &nbsp;Because most ships
can reduce their broadband source level by ~1 dB by
slowing down by 1 knot <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Veirs2016-tb}</cite>, in our study area the 3 dB noise reduction target could be met
by enforcing a speed limit of 11.8 knots (6.1 m/s) which would affect 83% of the ship population. For comparison, the mean and standard
deviation of the speed distribution is 14.1 ± 3.9 knots for the ship
population and 19 ± 2 knots for the fastest class, container ships&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Veirs2016-tb}</cite>. While the compliance burden would fall more broadly across the
fleet than with the removal or reduction options (Figure 2),
faster-moving ships would be required to reduce speed more than other
ships, and slow-moving classes would be unaffected. If a uniform speed
limit of 11.8 knots conflicts with the “bare steerage” speed required
for safe navigation of ships in a particular class, the 3 dB reduction
could also be achieved by having all ships in the fleet decrease their
speed by 3 knots (Figure 2).</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">Any noise reduction achieved by decreasing ship speed will increase the
time that species are exposed to the lower noise levels. &nbsp;Behavioral
response and masking are driven not only by the noise level, but also by
a temporal overlap between the noise and the animal. A reduction of 3 dB
in the total radiated power of ships does not address this temporal
overlap, but in our study area, it would likely increase the functional
acoustic space of SRKWs substantially and lower the maximum ship noise
exposures that could cause behavioral responses or masking in the
species <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Holt2008-ht,Williams2013-tm,Williams2014-yi,Williams2016-rl}</cite>. Such benefits should be weighed against the increase
in temporal overlap that may result from speed reduction. At the same
time, other environmental effects of a speed limit should be considered,
including altered fuel efficiency (air pollution) and risk of collisions
(oil spills and ships striking baleen whales).</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">Proven technologies and techniques&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Southall2008-af,Audoly2015-ld}</cite>&nbsp;exist
for reducing ship noise. &nbsp;Combinations of them, without necessarily
altering speed, could be used to reduce source levels by 3 dB in each
ship across the entire fleet, or just in gross-polluting ships. &nbsp;To
date, however, minimal mitigation has been undertaken by the commercial
shipping industry, either due to lack of regulation or incentives to
adopt them.
Management vehicles include, at least: regulated vessel speed limits in
biologically important habitat, like those mandated off the U.S. East
Coast to reduce ship strike mortality in North Atlantic right whales;
tax incentives or subsidies to retrofit or replace noisy ships with
quieter ones, for which designs already exist&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Leaper2014-re}</cite>; regulated noise emission standards for all or some ships
entering into a state’s internal waters; or port-based incentives and
other measures. As examples of the latter, the Port of Vancouver, one
of the largest ports in SRKW critical habitat, is reducing berthing fees
through its EcoAction program to reward ships that are accredited as
quiet by ship-classification societies, and in 2017 piloted a voluntary slow-down in Haro Strait with a speed limit of 11 knots (speed through water) in which compliant ships could receive a $500 stipend.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div>
