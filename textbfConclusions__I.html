<h1 data-label="451871" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusions</h1><div class="ltx_p">If our analysis and inferences hold true for other regions,
identification of gross acoustic polluters could help guide the creation
of regional or port-devised incentives or regulatory requirements to
reduce underwater noise pollution. &nbsp;Although our sample is drawn from
one site in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, it represents one of the
largest archives of calibrated source characteristics for ships anywhere
in the world. Compared with solutions proposed for thornier
environmental problems like climate change <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Barrett2003-qo,Obama2017-hb}</cite>, managing ship noise may be more tractable in part because even a
relatively low compliance rate (e.g., 15-42.8 % of the fleet) could
yield major environmental improvements. Despite projections of ship
noise rising through 2030
(Frisk, 2012), optimal
management of the global fleet could begin to reduce the current
detrimental levels of noise without necessarily regulating the entire
fleet.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div>
