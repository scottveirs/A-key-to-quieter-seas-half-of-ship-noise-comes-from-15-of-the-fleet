<h1 data-label="451871" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusions</h1><div class="ltx_p">The distribution of source levels in our ship population indicates that the global fleet has an opportunity to halve radiated noise levels by managing only 15% of the fleet. Studies of the distribution of acoustic polluters, along with what determines the maximum and minimum source levels in each ship class, will help guide the creation
of regional or port-devised incentives or regulatory requirements to
reduce underwater noise pollution. &nbsp;</div>
