<h1 data-label="451871" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusions</h1><div class="ltx_p">The distribution of source levels in our ship population indicates an opportunity to halve radiated noise levels by managing as little as 15% of the fleet.  managing ship noise may be more tractable in part because even a
relatively low compliance rate (e.g., 15-42.8 % of the fleet) could
yield major environmental improvements. Despite projections of ship
noise rising through 2030&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Frisk2012-ml}</cite>, optimal
management of the global fleet could begin to reduce the current
detrimental levels of noise without necessarily regulating the entire
fleet.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div>
