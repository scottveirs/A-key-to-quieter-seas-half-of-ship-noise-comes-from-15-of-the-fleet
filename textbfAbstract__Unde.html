impacting a wide range of marine species.&nbsp;Ambient ocean noise levels
nearly doubled each decade from 1963-2007 in low-frequency bands
attributed to shipping, inspiring a pledge from the International
Maritime Organization to reduce ship noise and a call from the
International Whaling Commission for member nations to halve ship noise
within a decade. Our analysis of data from 1,582 ships reveals that half
of the total power radiated by a modern fleet comes from just 15% of
the ships, namely those with source levels above 179 dB re 1 μPa @ 1 m.
We present a range of management options for reducing ship noise
efficiently, including incentive-based programs, without necessarily
regulating the entire fleet.</div>
