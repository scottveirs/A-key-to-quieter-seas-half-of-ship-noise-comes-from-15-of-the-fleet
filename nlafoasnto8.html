<div class="ltx_p">Compared with solutions proposed for thornier
environmental problems like climate change <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Barrett2003-qo,Obama2017-hb}</cite>, managing ship noise may be more tractable in part because even a
relatively low compliance rate (e.g., 15-42.8 % of the fleet) could
yield major environmental improvements. Despite projections of ship
noise rising through 2030 <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Frisk2012-ml}</cite>, optimal
management of the global fleet could begin to reduce the current
detrimental levels of noise without necessarily regulating the entire
fleet.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div>
